# class-viewer
A graphical class viewer utility.

The JDK is freely downloadable from Sun and contains all the necessary tools to compile, run and debug Java code. The one downside is that the free tools are command line driven. Some of the tools could benefit greatly from a graphical user interface. In particular the JDK's javap utility is one such tool. This utility mimics javap's ability to list a class's methods and attributes while presenting the results via a user-friendly interface.
